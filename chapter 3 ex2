#Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except
#so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the progra

a = input('enter hours ')
b = input ('enter rate ')
try :
     A = float(a)
except :
    print('not a number ')
try :
    B = float (b)
except:
    print('not a number')
if A > 40 :
    pay = (A-40) * 1.5 * B + 40 * B
elif A <= 40 :
    pay = A * B
print (pay)
