# Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0

a = input('enter hours ')
b = input ('enter rate ')


A = float(a)
B = float(b)
if A > 40 :
    pay = (A-40) * 1.5 * B + 40 * B
elif A <= 40 :
    pay = A * B
print (pay)
